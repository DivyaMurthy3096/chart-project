<p> There are good fats, bad fats and now expensive fats. Butter, margarine and other fats and oils were among the top food categories that saw the highest rise in prices from October 2021 to October 2022.</p>

<p> The latest Consumer Price Index, a measure of change in prices paid by consumers for a basket of the popular American goods and services, brought bleak news for staple food items such as dairy products and eggs. The price of margarine jumped by 47% between October 2021 and October 2022, eggs by 43% and butter by nearly 27%. </p>

<p> Per the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the prices of dairy products have been on a steady rise since 2021: a pound of butter that cost $1.77 in October 2021 now sells for $3.19. Economists cite a number of reasons for the rise, including supply chain disruptions and the war in Ukraine. </p>

<p> However, there’s hope yet for staples, the prices of which can fluctuate depending on business conditions, according to Dr. Donald Dutkowsky, a professor emeritus of economics at Syracuse University.</p>

<p> “The prices of dairy and eggs tend to be cyclical in nature, so I believe their upswing won't be lasting,” he says. “Over time their prices will stabilize and may even come down.”</p>

<p> The same fluctuations are true for other food products that trend in the opposite direction: the CPI listed beef, veal and uncooked meats as products whose prices fell by 3.5 percent to 6.9 percent. </p>

<p> Dutkowsky believes the war in Ukraine, alongside disruptions due to the COVID-19 pandemic, has substantially increased the price of feed for cattle — which can leave farmers with few choices. </p>

<p> “Faced with that choice, many farmers choose to slaughter more of their animals rather than continue to feed them,” he says. “It's likely that the decrease in meat prices reflects the resulting increase in supply.” </p>

<p> The biggest jump in the CPI came in the form of a 95.2% increase in the prices of food at employee sites and schools for the same period. Dutkowsky credits the back-to-work surge of employees for the rise in the cost of food at offices and work venues. </p>

<p> “Bringing people back also led to the need to reboot the office cafeteria, which had closed,” he says. “This meant hiring and training workers again and purchasing food literally from the beginning. The startup costs had to be huge, which companies most likely passed on to the prices of their food sold.” </p>

<p> For customers feeling the pinch, Dutkowsky recommended a switch to budget-friendly substitutes until the prices cycle back down.
